## Topic
Earnings and housing units in Puerto Rico

## Introduction
Puerto Rico is located in the Caribbean Island and is home to over 3.1 million people. As a territory of the United States, Puerto Rico does not have many of the benefits that are offered to mainland U.S. citizens and therefore, some migrate to mainland U.S. for new opportunities. Puerto Rico is constantly in a cycle of recovery due to the high rate of natural disasters that occur every year and contribute to the insufficient local resources. The median household income is $20,539 with a poverty level of 43.5% of the Puerto Rican population (Census Bureau, n.d.). Earning a wage can become difficult and well as sustaining a household.

## Data
Earning and household’s unit data from 2010-2014 and 2015-2019 was obtained from The American Community Survey (ACS) that collects data on individuals in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The data includes 945 observations and 27 variables that include with and without earnings and total housing units. 

## Transformation
The data was entered in RStudio to produce an R-Markdown with the variable’s earnings and housing units. The purpose of the R-Markdown was to transform the data from ACS to produce a bivariate map that shows change over time in Puerto Rico.

## Analysis
As of 2019, Puerto Rico has a little over 1.1 million households with 2.75 persons per household, which is a 68.1 percent of occupied housing units. The bivariate map shows there are some areas in central Puerto Rico with no to low earnings with a smaller number of household units and areas with a higher population such as San Juan and Caguas with higher earnings and a higher number of households.
