## Topic
Plumbing in Puerto Rico as an indicator of poverty

## Introduction
Poverty in Puerto Rico is not new, but how plumbing can be an indicator of poverty is relatively a new concept. Deitz and Meehan (2019) explored plumbing poverty in mainland U.S. by geographically mapping hot spots across the U.S. to show the disparities in racial and geographic water insecurities. Deitz and Meehan (2019) found that households with lower-than-average incomes had incomplete plumbing along with minority households. The goal of this project is to shed some light into the “plumbing poverty” that contributes to the overall high levels of poverty in Puerto Rico.  

## Data
Data on total plumbing facilities for all housing units, complete plumbing facilities, and lacking complete plumbing facilities was obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2015-2019 that is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Categorical data was also obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau to supplement the findings on housing. In addition, estimations on households and plumbing facilities were obtained from IPUMS. 

## Transformation
Data obtained from ACS was transformed into a map to visualize the areas in Puerto Rico that lack complete plumbing facilities.

## Analysis
Puerto Rico has a population of 3,193,694 as of 2019 with a poverty level of 43.5% (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.). In 2019, Puerto Rico had 10,610 households lacking complete plumbing facilities and 3,077,622 households with complete facilities (IPUMS data analysis in Stata). It is important to note that the ACS has a different version of the survey in Puerto Rico, the PRCS with the plumbing facilities question also differentiating. 

The map of Puerto Rico shows that areas such as Coco and Salinas, in dark maroon, have over 700 households with incomplete plumbing facilities. Barranquitas and Corazón, in scarlet, have over 500 households that are lacking incomplete plumbing facilities. The map provides a picture of the disparities in the Southeast parts of Puerto Rico. Southeast of Puerto Rico is also the area where hurricanes tend to make landfall. 

## Future
A multiple regression analysis holding for income and race variables should be conducted to support the potential findings in this project.
